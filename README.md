This site has been created using the Ittolaja Angular-Bootstrap site generator, currently batch file and perl script based. See the resulting site.json file in app/public. The next version of the hyplern-web site will be based on the next generation Ittolaja generator which will work through interactive web panels and MongoDB storage.
